This is my first post! I am hope to use this blog to help me learn more about different topics in software development. I am currently working through the book [Imposter's Handbook](https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook/) by Rob Conery. Maybe as I work through the chapters, I can write a post briefly discussing the topics.

I hope you have a great day! And remember, even though you may sometimes be wrong, we are always learning.
